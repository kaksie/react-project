Nice to Have
- for the mockup, it would be nice if it was on a frontend developer friendly format like adobe xd for easier integration. The psd file provided also gives me enough information on the styles thou.

Missing Functionalities / Styles
- keywords functionality
- back to top functionality
- tried my best to complete all the major functionalities first except for the keywords field section which requires multiple field search so I decided to move on to other parts instead given the short amount of time. 
- for the styles, I tried to make it look as decent as possible given the short amount of time with basic responsive functionality.
- notable missing section is the hero section
- some spacing issues
- some font size, type, color issues
